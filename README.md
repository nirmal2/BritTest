Calculator

Write some code to calculate a result from a set of instructions.
Instructions comprise a keyword and a number that are separated by a space per line. Instructions are loaded from file and results are output to the screen. Any number of Instructions can be specified.
Instructions should be the add, divide, multiply and subtract operators, ignoring mathematical precedence. The last instruction should be "apply" and a number (e.g., "apply 3"). The calculator is then initialised with that number and the previous instructions are applied to that number.

Two examples of the calculator lifecycle might be:

Example 1.
 [Input from file]
add 2
multiply 3
apply 3

[Output to screen]
15

[Explanation]
(3 + 2) * 3 = 15

Example 2.
 [Input from file]
multiply 9
apply 5

[Output to screen]
45

[Explanation]
5 * 9 = 45

Please add Specflow/Cucumber/ test suite with Features and Step definition for the Calculator app to test the conditions given above (preferably c# )

Upload it to a personal git/github and share the link.
